The Precedence Oriented Model Checker is a model checker for recursive procedural programs and context-free properties such as pre/post conditions and exception safety. It supports a custom programming language, MiniProc, and specifications expressed in the logic <a href='https://doi.org/10.46298/lmcs-18(3:11)2022'>POTL</a> (standing for Precedence Oriented Temporal Logic). An extension for probabilistic recursive programs (POPACheck) is ongoing work. The tool is written in Haskell.

Two tools for synthesizing controllers for  Markov Decision Processes against probabilistic hyperproperty specifications. They are extensions of <a href='https://github.com/randriu/synthesis'>PAYNT</a>, and use a customized version of <a href='https://www.stormchecker.org/'>STORM</a> as underlying model checker. The tools are written in Python.
