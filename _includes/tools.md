The Precedence Oriented Model Checker is a model checker for recursive procedural programs and context-free properties such as pre/post conditions and exception safety. It supports a custom programming language, MiniProc, and specifications expressed in the logic <a href='https://doi.org/10.46298/lmcs-18(3:11)2022'>POTL</a> (standing for Precedence Oriented Temporal Logic). An extension for probabilistic recursive programs is ongoing work. The tool is written in Haskell.

A tool for synthesizing controllers for  Markov Decision Processes against probabilistic hyperproperty specifications. It is an extension of <a href='https://github.com/randriu/synthesis'>PAYNT</a>, and uses <a href='https://www.stormchecker.org/'>STORM</a> as underlying model checker. The tool is written in Python.
