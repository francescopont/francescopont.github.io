<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am a Ph.D. student in the Trustworthy Cyber-Physical Systems Research Group at TU Wien, under the supervision of Prof. <a href='http://www.eziobartocci.com/'>Ezio Bartocci</a>, Dr. <a href='https://michiari.github.io/'>Michele Chiari</a> and Prof. <a href='http://lkovacs.com/'>Laura Kov√°cs</a>.
I am also part of the <a href='https://www.vcla.at/msca'>LogiCS@TUWien</a> Doctoral Programme.

I work on verification and synthesis problems for probabilistic programs and systems, both theoretically and practically. The main hammer I use is **probabilistic model checking**. My interests cover automata theory, formal languages, formal methods, temporal logics, probabilistic programming and Bayesian inference, and planning techniques in probabilistic environments.

Within <a href='https://corpora-lab.github.io/'>Corpora Lab</a> we investigate programs that involve both recursion and randomization, while in <a href='https://probing-lab.github.io/'>ProbIng Lab</a> we analyse so called probabilistic hyperproperties, i.e. properties correlating multiple executions of a probabilistic system.

I am passionate about functional programming and in particular the Haskell programming language.

Besides computer science research, I love studying history.
